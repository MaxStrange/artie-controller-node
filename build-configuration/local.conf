##RaspberryPi 0, 1, 2 and CM will have UART console enabled by default.
##
##RaspberryPi 0 WiFi and 3 does not have the UART enabled by default because this
##needs a fixed core frequency and enable_uart will set it to the minimum. Certain
##operations - 60fps h264 decode, high quality deinterlace - which aren't
##performed on the ARM may be affected, and we wouldn't want to do that to users
##who don't want to use the serial port. Users who want serial console support on
##RaspberryPi 0 Wifi or 3 will have to explicitly set in local.conf:
##
##    ENABLE_UART = "1"
#ENABLE_UART = "1"
#In order to use CAN with an MCP2515-based module, set the following variables:
#
#    ENABLE_SPI_BUS = "1"
#    ENABLE_CAN = "1"
#
#In case of dual CAN module (e.g. PiCAN2 Duo), set following variables instead:
#
#    ENABLE_SPI_BUS = "1"
#    ENABLE_DUAL_CAN = "1"
#
#Some modules may require setting the frequency of the crystal oscillator used on the particular board. The frequency is usually marked on the package of the crystal. By default, it is set to 16 MHz. To change that to 8 MHz, the following variable also has to be set:
#
#    CAN_OSCILLATOR="8000000"
#
#Tested modules:
#
#* PiCAN2 (16 MHz crystal): <http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican2-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-23-p-1475.html>
#* WaveShare RS485 CAN HAT (8 MHz or 12 MHz crystal): <https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-hat.htm>
#* PiCAN2 Duo (16 MHz crystal): <http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican2-duo-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-23-p-1480.html>
#ENABLE_SPI_BUS = "1"
#ENABLE_CAN = "1"
#When using device tree kernels, set this variable to enable gpio-shutdown:
#
#    ENABLE_GPIO_SHUTDOWN = "1"
#
#This will add the corresponding device tree overlay to config.txt and include
#the gpio-keys kernel module in the image. If System V init is used, additional
#mapping is applied to bind the button event to shutdown command. Systemd init
#should handle the event out of the box.
#
#By default the feature uses gpio pin 3 (except RPi 1 Model B rev 1 enumerates
#the pin as gpio 1). This conflicts with the I2C bus. If you set `ENABLE_I2C`
#to `1` or enabled `PiTFT` support, or otherwise want to use another pin, use
#`GPIO_SHUTDOWN_PIN` to assign another pin. Example using gpio pin 25:
#
#     GPIO_SHUTDOWN_PIN = "25"
#ENABLE_GPIO_SHUTDOWN = "1"
#GPIO_SHUTDOWN_PIN = "25"

# Package Management configuration
#
# This variable lists which packaging formats to enable. Multiple package backends
# can be enabled at once and the first item listed in the variable will be used
# to generate the root filesystems.
# Options are:
#  - 'package_deb' for debian style deb files
#  - 'package_ipk' for ipk files are used by opkg (a debian style embedded package manager)
#  - 'package_rpm' for rpm style packages
# E.g.: PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm package_deb package_ipk"
# We default to rpm:
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
#PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_ipk"

# Extra image configuration defaults
#
# The EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES variable allows extra packages to be added to the generated
# images. Some of these options are added to certain image types automatically. The
# variable can contain the following options:
#  "dbg-pkgs"       - add -dbg packages for all installed packages
#                     (adds symbol information for debugging/profiling)
#  "src-pkgs"       - add -src packages for all installed packages
#                     (adds source code for debugging)
#  "dev-pkgs"       - add -dev packages for all installed packages
#                     (useful if you want to develop against libs in the image)
#  "ptest-pkgs"     - add -ptest packages for all ptest-enabled packages
#                     (useful if you want to run the package test suites)
#  "tools-sdk"      - add development tools (gcc, make, pkgconfig etc.)
#  "tools-debug"    - add debugging tools (gdb, strace)
#  "eclipse-debug"  - add Eclipse remote debugging support
#  "tools-profile"  - add profiling tools (oprofile, lttng, valgrind)
#  "tools-testapps" - add useful testing tools (ts_print, aplay, arecord etc.)
#  "debug-tweaks"   - make an image suitable for development
#                     e.g. ssh root access has a blank password
# There are other application targets that can be used here too, see
# meta/classes/image.bbclass and meta/classes/core-image.bbclass for more details.
# We default to enabling the debugging tweaks.

# enable extra features. Some available options which can be included in this variable

#   - 'buildstats' collect build statistics

# Disk Space Monitoring during the build
#
# Monitor the disk space during the build. If there is less that 1GB of space or less
# than 100K inodes in any key build location (TMPDIR, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR), gracefully
# shutdown the build. If there is less than 100MB or 1K inodes, perform a hard halt
# of the build. The reason for this is that running completely out of space can corrupt
# files and damages the build in ways which may not be easily recoverable.
# It's necessary to monitor /tmp, if there is no space left the build will fail
# with very exotic errors.
